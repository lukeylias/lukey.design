        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="description">
          At nib, I own experimentation for the sales team. I identify what to
          test, design and code variants in Optimizely and React, and analyse
          results. I also standardised accessibility practices across the
          organisation, which led to an invitation to speak alongside Dylan
          Alcott on International Accessibility Day.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I've been integrating AI into my workflow since local LLMs became
          viable. I've built custom MCPs that connect models directly to design
          system documentation, and created an automated accessibility auditor
          that scans code against WCAG standards. I'm interested in how AI can
          remove friction from design operations, not replace the thinking.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Before nib, I spent four years at Greater Bank during their digital
          transformation. I designed the native iOS and Android experiences from
          scratch, built their first design system, and led the migration from
          Sketch to Figma. I also shipped a secure messaging feature that made a
          non-customer say, "I would change banks for this."
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          I think in systems, ship in code, and build tools when something's
          missing. I've mentored ~14 designers on experimentation and
          accessibility, pitched directly to divisional leadership to secure
          investment in design infrastructure, and collaborate regularly across
          disciplines: legal, content, marketing, design ops, and front-line
          staff.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          My goal is to simplify complexity: take abstract problems and turn
          them into digestible parts that teams can act on. I draw connections
          across people, product, and process to create clarity, and I bring
          others along on that journey.

          If something helps me, I find ways to share it. A process, a tool, a

      <h2>IWHI Funnel Redesign</h2>

      <div class="content-section">
        <p class="description">
          The project started as a straightforward technical rebuild: migrate
          the International Workers Health Insurance funnel to Next.js and
          replicate what already existed. No scope for changes.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          I saw this as a missed opportunity. I asked the product manager if
          there was a fixed deadline and whether we could use this rebuild as an
          opportunity to address known issues and refresh the design language.
          The answer was yes.

          The original IWHI funnel (before redesign)
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          I dug into ContentSquare and past research. The existing funnel was
          built for users with high intent to join, which alienated anyone just
          shopping around for prices. There were significant drop-offs
          throughout, users looping back because key information wasn't
          persisted, and a mobile experience that was broken in places. The UI
          hadn't been updated in years.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          I shaped a vision for the new funnel: simplify the visuals, improve
          content hierarchy, separate the quote experience from the join
          experience, and give users the context they need upfront. Transparency
          around pricing, clearer expectations, meaningful colour choices, and a
          responsive layout that actually works.

          I also jumped into the codebase. The initial implementation was
          inconsistent, so I built a layout component to standardise the
          experience across pages and worked through the funnel to align
          typography, colour, and responsiveness with the design system.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          I advocated for a new carousel component, prototyped it on GitHub, and
          co-designed it with the design ops team to get it into the Mesh design
          system. It's now part of the new funnel.

          When the experimentation team was disbanded, ownership of Optimizely

          too long to plan, run, and learn from.

          Lean experimentation process overview

        <p class="description">
          I built a lean experimentation process designed for speed: identify
          issues through data (ContentSquare, Google Analytics), form a testable
          hypothesis tied to a business outcome, design and develop variants,
          and run. I handle the full end-to-end from analysis through to
          building variants in Optimizely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or
          routing directly in React.

        <p class="description">
          One experiment stands out: I noticed high bounce rates and low scroll
          depth on our quote funnel entry point. My hypothesis was that the
          value exchange wasn't clear enough and users saw too many fields
          before seeing products. I designed variations that addressed this. The
          result was
          <strong class="highlight"

          The process I created has since been adopted by other teams across the

        </p>

        <p class="description">
          Not every experiment wins. I redesigned our product cards based on
          solid design rationale, but it underperformed users were more attached
          to the familiar layout than I expected. That's the point though:
          experimentation lets you test assumptions cheaply before committing
          engineering effort to something that might not move the needle.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          One shift I pushed for was rethinking how we pick metrics. The
          previous approach often measured vanity metrics clicks on a button,
          for example rather than outcomes that matter to the business. I
          introduced proxy metrics tied to conversion, so even when we can't
          measure the final outcome directly, we're still learning something
          meaningful.

          When I joined Greater Bank, design lived in Sketch with a painful
          check-in/check-out process—no cloud collaboration, constant version
          conflicts, and non-designers completely locked out. I'd been watching
          Figma since it launched and saw an opportunity.

          report back with findings. The result was a resounding
          yes—collaboration improved immediately, friction dropped, and the only
          real pain point (converting Sketch files) was already solved by
          Figma's import tool. We made the switch.

          The design system grew alongside this. Initially it was a side
          project—no formal buy-in, just something we maintained because it made
          our work faster. That changed when a merger was announced and we'd
          need to support multiple brands.

          I saw the opening. The executive of our digital transformation
          division asked for a business case they could take to the board. I
          built one: an accessibility-first, iterative design system grounded in
          best practices I'd gathered from reaching out to design ops people in
          the community, including folks at Figma. It got sign-off.

          I also created a pitch deck to communicate the value to teams across
          the division—what a design system is, how it would help velocity, why
          it mattered. It built momentum.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          The constraint was resources: no dedicated team, so it had to be built
          alongside other work. I evaluated tools and landed on Supernova
          because it worked with Style Dictionary, allowing design tokens to
          flow into iOS, Android, and web through a single source of truth.

      <div class="content-section">
        <p class="description">
          The existing student portal was fragmented across multiple systems,
          creating confusion for students trying to access essential services
          like enrollment, timetables, and academic records. Students were
          spending excessive time navigating between different platforms to
          complete basic tasks.

          The redesigned student portal dashboard

        <p class="description">
          I conducted user research with students across different faculties to
          understand their primary needs and pain points. Based on these
          insights, I designed a unified portal interface that consolidated key
          services into a single, intuitive dashboard.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          The redesign focused on reducing cognitive load by grouping related
          functions together and providing clear visual hierarchy. I worked
          closely with the development team to ensure the design was technically
          feasible within the existing university systems.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          User testing showed a <strong class="highlight">35% reduction</strong>
          in time spent navigating to key services, and student satisfaction
          scores improved significantly. The new portal became the foundation
          for future student experience improvements.

        A web accessibility tool that translates WCAG guidelines into plain

      <p class="description">
        I built Sa11y because accessibility auditing is intimidating for
        non-experts. Most tools assume you already understand WCAG. Sa11y
        explains what's wrong and why it matters in terms anyone can follow.

        The site itself is built to model best-in-class accessibility standards:
        semantic HTML, clear hierarchy, and tested against the same criteria it
        checks for.
